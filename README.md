# GDP Analysis and Visualization Dashboard
This Software Design and Analysis Project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization system that processes World Bank GDP Data and generates multiple data representation visuals for both region-wise and country-wise data selection. The entire workflow is derived from a JSON configuration file which makes the system flexible and reusable.
