# GDP Analysis and Visualization Dashboard
This Software Design and Analysis Project is a Python-based data analysis and visualization system that processes World Bank GDP Data and generates multiple data representation visuals for both region-wise and country-wise data selection. The entire workflow is derived from a JSON configuration file which makes the system flexible and reusable.

## Project Objectives
- Load, Clean and FIlter GDP Data according to JSON file
- Transform GDP csv file data into analysis-prepared data
- Apply statistical operations according to user preferences
- Visualize GDP Trends
    * Region-wise Representation (Bar Graph, Pie Chart, Heatmap)
    * Country-wise Representation (Line Plot, Scatter Plot, Histogram)
- Control execution using a validated JSON configuration file
